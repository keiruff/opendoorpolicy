# Open Door Policy — Know Your Rights, Protect Your Peace

Open Door Policy is a clear, worker-centered guide for anyone dealing with retaliation, discrimination, harassment, or HR misconduct. The goal is simple:
teach employees how to document patterns, protect themselves, and stay grounded when the workplace becomes hostile.

This project exists because most workers are told “HR is here to help” — and then discover the truth the hard way. This site gives you the tools HR hopes you never learn.

## 🧠 About the Creator

Open Door Policy was created by Keisha Ruffner, a public-sector employee who experienced retaliation, discrimination, and HR gaslighting firsthand.

When policies failed, HR stalled, and documentation disappeared into silence, Keisha did what many workers are forced to do:
she taught herself workplace protections, timelines, procedures, and effective documentation strategies.

What began as survival became a mission.

Open Door Policy exists so workers don’t have to start from zero or feel confused about what they’re experiencing.
It’s here to help you name it, track it, and protect your sanity in systems designed to exhaust you.

This is not legal advice — it’s a worker-to-worker guide built on research, patterns, and real experience navigating retaliation.
