      <h1>How to Document Retaliation at Work<br>So It Actually Holds Up</h1>
      <p class="subhead">
        HR talks about “open door policies.” This guide teaches you how to build a paper trail
        they can’t ignore — or quietly erase.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        Retaliation is illegal, but bad employers do it anyway. Documentation is how you turn
        “I feel like they’re targeting me” into a clear, dated story that agencies, lawyers,
        and even nervous HR people have to take seriously. On this page, you’ll learn exactly
        what to track, how to write it, and the mistakes that weaken otherwise strong cases.

      <section id="what-is-retaliation" class="panel">
        <h2>What workplace retaliation looks like</h2>
        <div class="two-column">
          <div>
            <p>
              Retaliation happens after you do a protected thing — report harassment or discrimination,
              request an accommodation, take protected leave, support a coworker’s complaint,
              or talk to a government agency or lawyer. The company responds by making your job
              harder, smaller, or shorter.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sudden write-ups or “performance issues” after years of good reviews.</li>
              <li>Being removed from meetings, projects, or email threads you used to be in.</li>
              <li>Schedule changes that conflict with childcare, health, or transportation.</li>
              <li>Being isolated, moved, or seated away from your team.</li>
              <li>Comments like “you’re not a team player anymore” after you spoke up.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="callout">
              <strong>Key test:</strong> ask, “What changed after I reported the problem?”
              Documentation is you answering that question with dates, receipts, and patterns —
              not vibes.

      <!-- BEFORE YOU START -->
      <section id="before-you-start" class="panel">
        <h2>Before you start documenting</h2>
        <div class="two-column">
          <div>
            <h3>1. Pick a safe place for your notes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Use a personal notebook, phone, or laptop you control.</li>
              <li>A private cloud doc or email-to-yourself log works well.</li>
              <li>Avoid keeping your only copy on your work computer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Decide your goal</h3>
            <p>
              Do you want the behavior to stop, to transfer, to negotiate an exit,
              or to build a record for an EEOC charge or lawsuit? Knowing your goal will
              help you use the <a href="index.html#document" class="text-link">documentation tools</a>
              on the main site more strategically.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>3. Separate feelings from facts</h3>
            <p>
              Your feelings are valid. Agencies and lawyers, though, are obsessed with
              <em>facts</em>. When you write, focus on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Who was there.</li>
              <li>What they said or did (actual words if you remember them).</li>
              <li>What changed compared to before you spoke up.</li>
              <li>How it affected your work, pay, health, or opportunities.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout">
              <strong>Pro-tip:</strong> if you’re upset, voice-note or free-write first.
              Later, turn that into a calmer entry in your log.
            </div>

      <!-- STEP BY STEP LOG -->
      <section id="step-by-step-log" class="panel">
        <h2>How to document retaliation: step-by-step</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Each entry in your retaliation log should tell a tiny, clear story: what happened,
          when, who was involved, and how it connects to your protected activity.
        </p>

        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li><strong>Start your timeline with the protected activity.</strong>  
            Example: “On March 4, I reported harassment to HR via email.”</li>
          <li><strong>Create one entry per event.</strong>  
            New write-up? New schedule change? New comment? That’s a separate entry.</li>
          <li><strong>Use the same structure each time:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Date &amp; time</li>
              <li>Location (meeting, Teams call, hallway, email, etc.)</li>
              <li>People involved and any witnesses</li>
              <li>What was said or done — as close to exact wording as you can remember</li>
              <li>How this differed from your treatment before you spoke up</li>
              <li>Impact on your job, pay, health, or opportunities</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Attach receipts.</strong>  
            Screenshots, emails, calendar events, write-ups, policy PDFs — anything that
            backs up what you’re describing.</li>
          <li><strong>Log silence too.</strong>  
            If HR promises to “look into it” and then nothing happens, that gap is part
            of your story. Log the dates you followed up and got no meaningful response.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          You can download the log template from the homepage or keep using your own format.
          The important thing is consistency over time.

              <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-04-10, 2:15 PM</p>
              <p><strong>People:</strong> Supervisor, HR generalist</p>
              <p><strong>Event:</strong> I was called into an office and given a written warning for
              “negative attitude” and “not being a team player.” When I asked for examples, none
              were provided. This was 6 days after I emailed HR about repeated comments on my race
              from a coworker.</p>
              <p><strong>Difference from past treatment:</strong> In my last two annual reviews,
              my supervisor rated my attitude as “exceeds expectations.” I have not received any
              previous warnings.</p>
              <p><strong>Impact:</strong> I was told future incidents could “affect my employment,”
              which has increased my anxiety at work.</p>
              <p><strong>Receipts:</strong> Photo of warning, copies of last two reviews, email to HR
              dated 2025-04-04.</p>

              <p><strong>People:</strong> Manager</p>
              <p><strong>Event:</strong> Manager informed me my shift would change from 8–4:30 to
              10–6:30, starting next week. I previously received approval for the earlier shift as an
              accommodation for medical treatment.</p>
              <p><strong>Difference from past treatment:</strong> I have worked the 8–4:30 schedule
              for 11 months with no documented issues.</p>
              <p><strong>Impact:</strong> New shift conflicts with standing medical appointments and
              childcare pick-up. Manager said, “We all have lives; you’ll have to figure it out.”</p>
              <p><strong>Receipts:</strong> Email granting accommodation dated 2024-07-15, new
              schedule notice, calendar screenshots.</p>

            <h3>Only saving emails, never writing your own notes</h3>
            <p>
              Emails are great, but a lot of retaliation happens in conversations,
              “off the record” meetings, or body language. Your log fills those gaps.
            </p>

            <h3>Writing essays instead of short entries</h3>
            <p>
              Long paragraphs are hard to skim. Think like a timeline: short, dated entries
              that a stranger can follow quickly.

          <article class="info-card">
            <h3>Guessing about motives</h3>
            <p>
              “They hate me” isn’t evidence. “After I reported harassment on March 4, my
              workload doubled on March 10” is. Stick to actions and dates.

            <h3>Keeping everything on the work computer</h3>
            <p>
              If they lock you out, you lose your case file. Always have a copy on a
              personal device or cloud account you control.

        <h2>What to do with your retaliation documentation</h2>

          <div>
            <h3>1. Use it inside the company</h3>
            <p>
              When you meet with HR or management, bring a printed or digital version of
              your timeline. After every meeting, send a recap email —
              then log that too. The
              <a href="index.html#templates" class="text-link">email templates</a>
              on the homepage can help.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Use it with agencies and lawyers</h3>
            <p>
              Government agencies and employment lawyers love clean timelines. Your log
              becomes the backbone of your intake form, charge, or consultation.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>3. Keep updating, even if you’re tired</h3>
            <p>
              Retaliation wears people down on purpose. The most powerful thing you can do
              is quietly keep writing. One strong timeline can outweigh a pile of HR spin.
