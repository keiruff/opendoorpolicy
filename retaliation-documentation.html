        <h1>How to Document Workplace Retaliation the Smart Way</h1>
        <p class="subhead">
          Retaliation is when the company punishes you for doing the right thing — reporting harassment,
          asking for accommodation, or backing up a coworker. It feels messy. Your documentation cannot be.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          This page walks you through a simple, repeatable system to turn every shady move into
          clear evidence: what happened, when it started, and how it changed after you spoke up.
          It’s not legal advice. It’s a worker-built playbook so you’re not walking into HR or the EEOC empty-handed.

        <h2>1. Know what retaliation actually looks like</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Retaliation is a pattern, not just a bad mood from your manager. The key question:
          <strong>“Did this start or get worse after I spoke up?”</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="cards-grid">
          <article class="info-card">
            <h3>Typical retaliation moves</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>New write-ups or “performance issues” that never existed before.</li>
              <li>Schedule changes, location changes, or seating moves that isolate you.</li>
              <li>Workload suddenly doubled — or your good projects quietly removed.</li>
              <li>Being left out of meetings, emails, or information you need to do your job.</li>
            </ul>

          <article class="info-card">
            <h3>Why the timeline matters</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Agencies and lawyers care about <strong>before vs. after.</strong></li>
              <li>Your job is to show: “I reported on this date. <em>Then</em> things changed.”</li>
              <li>That link between your protected activity and the fallout is the whole game.</li>

            <h3>Your base toolkit</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>One main log (notebook, Google Doc, or secure notes app).</li>
              <li>Screenshot folder for emails, chats, write-ups, and schedule changes.</li>
              <li>Copies of company policies, job description, and prior reviews.</li>
              <li>A separate folder for anything you send HR or management.</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="font-size:0.85rem;">
              You can use the framework from the main
              <a href="/#document">Documentation Plan</a> and apply it specifically to retaliation.
            </p>

            <h3>Every entry should answer five questions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>When?</strong> Date, time, location.</li>
              <li><strong>Who?</strong> Names and roles of everyone involved.</li>
              <li><strong>What happened?</strong> Exact words, actions, or changes.</li>
              <li><strong>What’s different now?</strong> How it compares to before you spoke up.</li>
              <li><strong>Proof?</strong> What emails, screenshots, or witnesses back it up.</li>

              <p><strong>People:</strong> Supervisor, HR rep</p>
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> I filed a written complaint about harassment on 2025-02-20.</p>
              <p><strong>Event:</strong> In my review meeting, supervisor said my “attitude” had changed
              and gave me my first written warning in eight years, citing “team fit” with no prior coaching.</p>
              <p><strong>Change from before:</strong> My last review (2024) rated me “exceeds expectations”
              with no mention of attitude or team fit.</p>
              <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Written warning placed in file; I’m now being watched and excluded from
              client calls.</p>
              <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Copy of warning, last year’s review, complaint email from 02-20,
              calendar invite for review meeting.</p>

              As long as the pattern continues. Document from the moment you speak up
              until things genuinely stabilize — or until you’re out and have talked
              with a lawyer or agency about what they need. More data gives you more options.

              No. Your log is for you. What you <em>do</em> need to share are clear,
              written complaints and follow-ups. Those show you tried to resolve things
              internally before escalating.

              Keep everything. Exit emails, resignation letters, final schedules,
              write-ups, and your log still matter. Some claims are time-limited, so
              talk to an employment lawyer or workers’ rights clinic sooner rather than later.
