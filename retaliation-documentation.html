<h1>How to Document Retaliation at Work</h1>
<p class="section-intro">
Retaliation is the most common workplace claim filed with the EEOC — and the least understood by workers. 
This guide shows you exactly how to document retaliation in a way that holds up with HR, lawyers, and government agencies.

<h2>What Counts as Retaliation?</h2>
<p>
Retaliation is any negative action your employer takes against you because you reported a concern, asked for an accommodation, or used your legal rights. 
You don’t need to prove intent. You only need:  
<strong>(1) a protected activity</strong> → <strong>(2) a negative action</strong> → <strong>(3) a timeline connecting the two.</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reporting harassment or discrimination</li>
  <li>Filing an HR complaint</li>
  <li>Requesting ADA accommodations</li>
  <li>Taking FMLA leave</li>
  <li>Helping someone else file a complaint</li>
</ul>

<p>Retaliation often looks like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sudden write-ups after years of good performance</li>
  <li>Being excluded from meetings or training</li>
  <li>Increased workload or impossible deadlines</li>
  <li>Access or tools removed without explanation</li>
  <li>Hostile treatment from management</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Retaliation Documentation Strategy</h2>
<p>
Think of your documentation as a <strongtimeline of cause and effect</strong>.  
You’re building a clear story: “After I spoke up, things changed. Here’s proof.”
</p>

<h3>1. Start With Your Protected Activity</h3>
<p>Document the event that triggered retaliation, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HR complaint filed on <strong>[date]</strong></li>
  <li>Email reporting harassment on <strong>[date]</strong></li>
  <li>Request for ADA accommodations on <strong>[date]</strong></li>
  <li>FMLA leave approved on <strong>[date]</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Your entire timeline starts here.</p>

<h3>2. Log Every Negative Change</h3>
<p>Each new incident becomes an entry in your retaliation log:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Date + time</li>
  <li>Who was involved</li>
  <li>Exactly what happened (quotes if possible)</li>
  <li>How it affected your work</li>
  <li>How it differs from how you were treated before</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Compare “Before vs. After”</h3>
<p>This is where your power comes from.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before reporting: positive reviews → After reporting: sudden performance issues</li>
  <li>Before reporting: access to tools → After reporting: access removed</li>
  <li>Before reporting: normal workload → After reporting: unreasonable assignments</li>
</ul>

<p>Patterns speak louder than any HR meeting.</p>

<h2>Example Retaliation Log Entry</h2>

<div class="example-box">
<p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-09-18 (9:45 AM)</p>
<p><strong>People involved:</strong> Manager, Team Lead</p>
<p><strong>Event:</strong> During a project review, my manager questioned my workload and claimed I was “not keeping up,” despite having documented medical accommodations.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> Public embarrassment, stress, increased expectations contradicting prior agreements.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up:</strong> Sent HR a recap email requesting clarification of approved accommodations.</p>
</div>

<p>This format is simple, factual, and legally effective.</p>

<h2>How to Build a Strong Retaliation Case</h2>

<h3>1. Keep Everything in Writing</h3>
<p>
If a meeting happens verbally, follow it with:
<br>
<em>“Per our conversation today, my understanding is…”</em>
</p>

<h3>2. Screenshot Everything</h3>
<p>Access removed? Team messages? Changed deadlines? Capture them.</p>

<h3>3. Track HR’s Silence</h3>
<p>
Lack of response <strong>is evidence</strong>.  
Write down when you reported and when they failed to follow up.
</p>

<h3>4. Collect Comparator Evidence</h3>
<p>
Are others treated differently? Write it down.  
Comparators strengthen retaliation claims dramatically.
</p>

<h3>5. Build a Clear Timeline</h3>
<p>
Your goal is a sequence like:
<br><strong>Protected activity → Negative changes → Escalation → Documentation</strong>
</p>

<h2>When HR Ignores Your Complaint</h2>
<p>
HR silence is not neutral — it’s part of the pattern.  
If weeks pass with no follow-up, escalate:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Email HR supervisor or compliance department</li>
  <li>Send a factual recap of everything documented</li>
  <li>Attach your timeline and unanswered emails</li>
</ul>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Note:</strong> Filing with the EEOC triggers a litigation hold, requiring your employer to preserve all related records.

<section class="panel">
<h2>When to Get Outside Help</h2>
<p>Multiple agencies can support retaliation cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>EEOC</strong> – discrimination & retaliation claims</li>
  <li><strong>State Human Rights Agencies</strong></li>
  <li><strong>ADA Coordinators</strong> (for disability retaliation)</li>
  <li><strong>Employment lawyers</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to quit your job to file a claim.</p>
