        Most people don’t know what to do when work turns hostile. HR isn’t neutral, and complaints
        often get ignored or flipped back onto the employee. This site gives you the tools to
        document everything — conversations, assignments, retaliation, access issues, patterns —
        in a way that protects you legally and keeps you in control.

                <strong>Event:</strong> During the project review meeting, my manager

                up,” despite prior approval for reduced duties under medical accommodation.

              <p>

      <!-- Know Your Rights -->
      <section id="rights" class="panel">
        <h2>Know Your Rights at Work</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          You don’t have to be a lawyer to understand your protections. Federal law says you have the right to a safe, respectful workplace — and you cannot legally be punished for reporting harassment or discrimination.
        </p>

        <div class="two-column">
          <div>
            <h3>What counts as harassment</h3>
            <p>
              Harassment isn’t just yelling or touching — it’s any behavior that targets you based on who you are, or punishes you for speaking up. It can be verbal, digital, psychological, or physical.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>“Jokes” or comments about race, gender, disability, age, or religion.</li>
              <li>Managers who move deadlines or expectations to make you fail.</li>
              <li>Isolation or exclusion after reporting misconduct.</li>
              <li>Supervisors using authority to intimidate or control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your legal protections</h3>
            <p>In the U.S., these laws protect you from workplace discrimination and retaliation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</strong> — protects against bias based on race, sex, religion, and national origin.</li>
              <li><strong>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</strong> — covers mental and physical disabilities.</li>
              <li><strong>Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)</strong> — protects workers aged 40 and older.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>If you’re being harassed</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Document everything.</strong> Write down dates, names, and details. Save emails, screenshots, or messages.</li>
              <li><strong>Report internally</strong> if safe — use email and keep copies of what you send and receive.</li>
              <li><strong>File externally</strong> with the EEOC or your state’s Fair Employment Practices Agency if HR ignores or dismisses your concern.</li>
              <li><strong>Seek outside help.</strong> Legal aid, unions, and worker centers can assist even if you can’t afford a lawyer.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Retaliation is illegal</h3>
            <p>
              Retaliation means being punished for doing the right thing — like reporting harassment, requesting accommodation, or helping someone file a complaint.
              It can look like:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Demotion, reassignment, or being left out of meetings.</li>
              <li>Bad reviews after years of good performance.</li>
              <li>Increased workload or impossible deadlines.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout">
              <strong>Remember:</strong> You don’t have to prove intent — only that the retaliation happened after you exercised your rights.

        <h2>Inside the company: how to move smart</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          HR is not your therapist. HR protects the company. Use internal channels on
          purpose, with receipts.
        </p>

        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Decide the goal.</strong> Do you want the behavior to stop, a
            transfer, documentation for the record, or all of the above? Knowing this
            shapes what you say.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Follow written policy.</strong> Most handbooks spell out how to
            report harassment, discrimination, or safety issues. Following that path
            helps later if the company ignores it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use email, not just conversations.</strong> After meetings, send
            recap emails: “Per our conversation today, my understanding is…”. This
            locks in what was said.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Be factual, not emotional.</strong> You can be firm without
            venting. Stick to dates, quotes, and impacts on your work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Save everything.</strong> Screenshots, emails, Teams/Slack
            messages, performance reviews, seating charts, policy PDFs.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Important:</strong> If you feel unsafe or targeted after reporting,
          that can be retaliation. Document every change that happens
          <em>after</em> you speak up.

Hi [Name],

I’m following up to document what happened on [date] in [location].

[Very short description: who, what was said/done, impact on your work.]

This behavior concerns me because it may violate our policies on [harassment / discrimination / retaliation]. I’d like this documented and addressed.

Thank you,

            <p>
              Treat it like a timeline. Start with the date you reported a concern
              (harassment, discrimination, safety, etc.). Then log every change
              that happened after: new write-ups, schedule changes, comments,
              demotions, projects taken away, people you were told not to talk to.
            </p>
            <p>
              For each entry, capture: date, who was involved, what was said or
              done, and how it differs from how you were treated <em>before</em>
              you spoke up.
            </p>

            What if HR ignores my complaint?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              First, document the silence. Save your original report and note any
              lack of response or vague “we’re looking into it” replies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then decide your next step: follow up once in writing (“Can you
              confirm what steps have been taken so far?”), and if nothing changes,
              consider external options like an EEOC charge, a state agency
              complaint, a union rep, or a workers’ rights clinic.
            </p>
            <p>
              HR doing nothing is not neutral — it’s part of the pattern.

            Can I be fired for going to a government agency or lawyer?
          </button>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Employers are not supposed to punish you for talking to a government
              agency about discrimination or harassment, or for consulting a
              lawyer. Retaliation for using those channels can itself be illegal.
            </p>
            <p>
              That doesn’t mean bad employers never try it. That’s why your
              documentation matters: keep records of when you reached out for
              help and what changed afterward.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              You may still have options. Some claims have strict deadlines
              (sometimes as short as 180 days in the U.S.), but others may allow
              more time or different types of complaints.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gather your timeline, documents, and any policies you have, then
              talk to an employment lawyer, legal aid clinic, or workers’ rights
              group. Let a professional tell you what’s off the table — don’t
              assume you have no options just because you’re out of that job.

        <p class="section-intro">
          This site wasn’t written by HR. It was written by someone who’s survived HR.
          I’ve sat through the “open door” meetings, the “we value transparency” speeches,
          and the “we take all complaints seriously” emails that never went anywhere.
        </p>

        <div class="two-column">

            <p>
              I’m <strong>Keisha Ruffner</strong> — just another employee who had to learn
              how to document, protect, and keep her sanity inside a system designed to make
              you question your memory. When HR says “we’re neutral,” it usually means
              “we’re collecting information for management.”
            </p>
            <p>
              I built <strong>Open Door Policy</strong> so regular workers have a place to
              learn how the system really works — and how to work around it. Because your
              performance review shouldn’t double as an interrogation transcript.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn’t legal advice. It’s a survival guide. 
              Think of it as HR’s worst nightmare: an employee who writes things down.
