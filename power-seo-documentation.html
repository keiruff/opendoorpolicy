        <p class="subhead">
          This is the long-form playbook for when work turns hostile and HR starts acting like a PR team.
          It walks you through how to build a clean record so you’re not gaslit out of your own reality.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          You don’t need legal language. You need receipts: dates, people, what changed, and how it hit your
          work and health. This guide shows you how to turn “I know they’re doing something” into a clear,
          chronological story that agencies, lawyers, and even HR can’t easily spin away.

        <h2>1. Mindset & safety before you start</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Retaliation documentation isn’t about being dramatic. It’s about refusing to let people
          rewrite what actually happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you start logging, decide what you’re protecting:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your health and sanity.</li>
          <li>Your income and career record.</li>
          <li>Your ability to file a clean complaint later if you choose.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Also ask: <strong>What is my risk level at work?</strong> If you fear immediate retaliation or safety
          issues, talk to a trusted person, therapist, union rep, or legal aid clinic first. Documentation
          is powerful, but you shouldn’t feel like you’re walking through a war zone alone.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- 2. What retaliation looks like -->
      <section class="panel" id="signals">
        <h2>2. What retaliation looks like in real life</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Retaliation is anything negative that happens because you exercised a protected right
          — like reporting harassment, requesting accommodation, or supporting a coworker’s complaint.
        </p>
        <p>Common patterns include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sudden write-ups or “performance issues” after years of good reviews.</li>
          <li>Being isolated, left off emails, or excluded from meetings you used to attend.</li>
          <li>Deadlines moved so you’re set up to fail, then blamed for “not keeping up.”</li>
          <li>Schedule changes, worse assignments, or petty rules applied only to you.</li>
          <li>Supervisors using tone, body language, or comments to intimidate you for speaking up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          One weird day is annoying. A cluster of these after you report something is a <strong>pattern</strong>.
          The pattern is what you’re documenting.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- 3. Anatomy of a strong log entry -->
      <section class="panel" id="log-anatomy">
        <h2>3. The anatomy of a strong log entry</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Every log entry should read like a snapshot a stranger could understand without knowing you.
        </p>

        <h3>Required pieces</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Date & time</strong> – when it happened.</li>
          <li><strong>Location / channel</strong> – office, Teams, email, phone, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>People involved</strong> – who said or did what (and who witnessed it).</li>
          <li><strong>What happened</strong> – short, factual description; no name-calling, no extra story.</li>
          <li><strong>Impact</strong> – how it affected your work, schedule, pay, health, or opportunities.</li>
          <li><strong>Follow-up</strong> – what you did next (email, ticket, HR report, nothing yet, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example entry</h3>
        <div class="example-box">
          <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2025-09-18, 9:45 AM (team meeting)</p>
          <p><strong>People:</strong> Manager Jordan, Team Lead Casey, full team present</p>
          <p><strong>Event:</strong> After I reminded Jordan of my approved medical accommodation,
            Jordan said “we all have problems” and questioned my workload in front of the team.
            No one else’s workload was discussed.</p>
          <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Public embarrassment, increased anxiety, and implied pressure
            to ignore the accommodation to keep my job.</p>
          <p><strong>Follow-up:</strong> Sent recap email to Jordan and HR summarizing the exchange
            and asking them to confirm my accommodation terms in writing.</p>
        </div>

      <!-- 4. Building the timeline -->
      <section class="panel" id="timeline">
        <h2>4. Building your timeline so patterns pop</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          The magic isn’t a single entry. It’s the pattern that appears when you line events up by date.
        </p>

        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Mark the “protected activity.”</strong>  
            Example: the day you reported harassment, requested accommodation,
            supported a coworker’s complaint, or contacted a government agency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Log everything that shifts after that date.</strong>  
            Assignments, write-ups, schedule changes, comments, exclusion from meetings, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Note who is driving each change.</strong>  
            Manager, HR, higher-up, coworker acting on orders, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Connect cause and effect.</strong>  
            Your timeline should read like: “Reported X on March 2 → schedule cut March 10 →
            write-up March 18 → moved desks March 25.”
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This is the backbone of a retaliation claim. Agencies and lawyers love clean timelines with
          dates and receipts attached.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- 5. Receipts -->
      <section class="panel" id="receipts">
        <h2>5. Meeting notes, recap emails, and “silent” evidence</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          A lot of retaliation happens in rooms with no witnesses or in “friendly” conversations.
          That’s where your written follow-ups come in.
        </p>

        <h3>After a sketchy meeting</h3>
        <p>Send a short recap email, like:</p>
        <div class="example-box">
          <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Recap of today’s meeting</p>
          <p>
            Hi [Name],<br><br>
            I’m writing to confirm my understanding of our meeting on [date]. We discussed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>[Your concern]</li>
            <li>[Any steps you said you would take]</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You stated that [summary of what they promised or explained]. If I’ve misunderstood
            anything, please let me know in writing.<br><br>
            Best,<br>
            [Your name]
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          That email now becomes evidence. If they don’t correct you, your version stands.
          If they do correct you, you’ve locked in their story too.
        </p>

        <h3>Other “quiet” receipts to save</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Policy PDFs before and after your complaint.</li>
          <li>Screenshots of Teams/Slack messages and channel removals.</li>
          <li>Performance reviews from before and after you spoke up.</li>
          <li>Seat charts, org charts, or duty lists that suddenly change.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- 6. Using your log with HR -->
      <section class="panel" id="hr-usage">
        <h2>6. Using your log with HR (and what to expect)</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          HR exists to protect the company. You’re using your log to protect your reality.
        </p>

        <p>When you’re ready to raise concerns formally, your documentation lets you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Give dates and examples instead of “vibes.”</li>
          <li>Point to specific policies or accommodations that aren’t being followed.</li>
          <li>Show a pattern over time instead of one argument or bad day.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you meet with HR:</p>
        <ol class="numbered-list">
          <li>Bring a printed copy or summary of your timeline.</li>
          <li>Stick to facts: dates, quotes, impact. Leave out side stories.</li>
          <li>Ask them to confirm next steps and expectations in writing.</li>
          <li>Log the meeting itself in your documentation afterward.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          If HR does nothing, delays, or turns the focus onto you instead of the behavior,
          that becomes part of the pattern — and part of your timeline.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- 7. External options -->
      <section class="panel" id="external">
        <h2>7. When to take your evidence outside the company</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Sometimes the point isn’t to “fix” the job — it’s to protect yourself and create a record
          with people who are actually neutral.
        </p>

        <p>Common external options (especially in the U.S.) include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>EEOC or state fair employment agencies (discrimination & retaliation).</li>
          <li>Labor departments (wages, overtime, misclassification, breaks).</li>
          <li>Occupational safety agencies (unsafe conditions, threats, hazards).</li>
          <li>Employment lawyers and legal aid clinics.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Each has deadlines, sometimes as short as 180 days. Your log makes it easier to talk to them:
          you already have dates, names, and a clear sequence of events.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a quick overview of outside resources, see
          <a href="index.html#external">“Outside help: who you can talk to” on the main site</a>.

      <!-- 8. Download & links -->
      <section class="panel" id="download">
        <h2>8. Download the log template & keep going</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          You don’t have to freestyle this in a notebook (unless you want to). Start with a structure
          that’s already built for retaliation cases.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
          Then use the rest of the toolkit:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="index.html#document">Your documentation plan</a> – high-level steps and examples.</li>
          <li><a href="index.html#templates">Copy-paste email & meeting templates</a> – to create written receipts.</li>

          <li><a href="index.html#hr-fails">When HR Fails</a> – how to escalate with precision.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          None of this makes what happened okay. It just means you’re no longer defenseless.
          You’re documenting the truth in a system that survives on confusion.
